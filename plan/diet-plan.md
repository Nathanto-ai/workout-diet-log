# Diet Plan (v0) — recomp-friendly + simple

## The rule

Start with a reasonable target, then adjust based on **2-week trend**.

- If weight trend drops **>0.7%/week** and training feels worse → add **+100–150 kcal**
- If weight trend doesn’t drop at all for **2 weeks** and you want fat loss → subtract **-100–150 kcal**
- If you’re gaining and don’t want to → subtract **-150 kcal**

## Starting targets (default)

**Calories:** 2,300 kcal/day  
**Protein:** 160–190 g/day  
**Fat:** 60–80 g/day  
**Carbs:** fill the rest

(These are starting points—update once we know your current step count/running volume.)

## Meal templates (mix & match)

### Template A — “Huel + real dinner” (fast, high-protein)
- Meal 1: Huel Black + milk (or water) + banana
- Meal 2: Huel Black + milk (or water)
- Dinner: 1 palm-and-a-half of lean protein + 1–2 cups cooked carbs + veggies + olive oil/sauce

### Template B — “2 big meals” (if you naturally skip breakfast)
- Lunch: big bowl (protein + carbs + veggies)
- Dinner: big bowl (protein + carbs + veggies)
- Snack: Greek yogurt / fruit / jerky / protein shake

### Template C — “Meal prep”
- Cook 2 proteins + 2 carb bases + frozen veggies
- Rotate 4–6 meals without thinking

## Simple portion guide (when not tracking)
