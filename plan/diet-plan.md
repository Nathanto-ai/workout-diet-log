# Diet Plan (v1) — recomp with macro tracking

## Primary target

You want fat loss + muscle gain + performance support. Start with a **small deficit / near-maintenance** setup.

- **Calories:** 2,250-2,350 kcal/day
- **Protein:** 160-185 g/day
- **Protein (evidence context):** ~1.6-2.2 g/kg/day is a strong range for performance/recomp
- **Fat:** 60-75 g/day
- **Carbs:** remainder (typically 210-290 g/day)

### How these calories and macros were calculated

Using your profile bodyweight range (163-167 lb = ~74-76 kg), recomp goal, and 5-6 training days/week:

1. **Calories**
   - Practical maintenance estimate from your activity level: ~2,350-2,550 kcal/day.
   - Recomp setup uses a small deficit on average: ~150-250 kcal below maintenance.
   - That gives a starting target of **2,250-2,350 kcal/day**.

2. **Protein**
   - Evidence-based range for recomp/performance: ~1.6-2.2 g/kg.
   - 74-76 kg x 1.6-2.2 = ~118-167 g/day.
   - We set a performance-forward target of **160-185 g/day** to better support strength and skill progress while dieting slowly.

3. **Fat**
   - Set around ~0.8-1.0 g/kg as a practical floor for hormones/satiety.
   - 74-76 kg x 0.8-1.0 = ~59-76 g/day.
   - Target used: **60-75 g/day**.

4. **Carbs (remainder)**
   - Carbs are set with remaining calories after protein + fat.
   - At 2,250 kcal with 170P/65F: carbs ~= (2250 - (170x4 + 65x9)) / 4 ~= 246 g.
   - At 2,350 kcal with 185P/75F: carbs ~= (2350 - (185x4 + 75x9)) / 4 ~= 234 g.
   - Practical range remains **~210-290 g/day** depending on run-day fueling and appetite.

### Adjustment rules (every 2 weeks)
- If weekly average weight drops faster than ~0.75 lb/week and workouts feel weaker: **+100 kcal/day**
- If weight is flat for 2 weeks and waist is not improving: **-100 kcal/day**
- If performance is improving and waist/weight trend are good: **hold steady**

## Preferred meal structure (your input)

Default day:
1. **Huel shake + 2% milk**
2. **Huel shake + 2% milk**
3. **High-protein dinner**

This is valid as long as daily macros and fiber are covered.

### Example macro split
- Shake 1: ~500-650 kcal, 35-50g protein
- Shake 2: ~500-650 kcal, 35-50g protein
- Dinner: ~900-1,200 kcal, 70-90g protein

> Check your exact Huel serving + milk quantity in app labels and log precisely.

## Dinner template (high compliance)

Build dinner with:
- **Protein:** 8-12 oz lean meat/fish OR tofu/tempeh equivalent
- **Carb:** 1.5-3 cups cooked rice/potato/pasta depending on run day
- **Vegetables:** at least 2 fists
- **Fat:** 1-2 tbsp olive oil / avocado / nuts

### Run-day carb tweak
- Interval/tempo days: add +25-60g carbs (fruit, rice, oats, bread)
- Rest/recovery day: keep carbs slightly lower if appetite is low

---

## Minimum nutrition floors

- Protein: never below **150g/day**
- Fiber: at least **25-35g/day**
- Water: **2.5-3.5 L/day**
- Sodium: do not under-salt, especially on running days

---


## Execution checklist (simple)

Use this daily:
- Hit **protein first** (150g absolute minimum; 165-185g target).
- Keep calories in the **2,250-2,350** range most days.
- On interval/tempo days, add carbs around training.
- If sleep is poor, keep food quality high and avoid large under-eating.

Use this weekly:
- Compare 7-day average bodyweight + waist trend + training quality.
- Then apply only one adjustment from the rules above.

## Logging protocol in this repo/chat

When you message updates, include:
- time
- workout completed (or rest)
- meals/snacks with rough quantities
- optional: energy (1-5), hunger (1-5)

I will translate your updates into:
- daily log entries in `/logs/`
- macro estimates and day-end summary
- next-day adjustments if needed
