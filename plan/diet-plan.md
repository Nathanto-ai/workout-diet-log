# Diet Plan (v1) — recomp with macro tracking

## Primary target

You want fat loss + muscle gain + performance support. Start with a **small deficit / near-maintenance** setup.

- **Calories:** 2,250-2,350 kcal/day
- **Protein:** 160-185 g/day
- **Protein (evidence context):** ~1.6-2.2 g/kg/day is a strong range for performance/recomp
- **Fat:** 60-75 g/day
- **Carbs:** remainder (typically 210-290 g/day)

### Adjustment rules (every 2 weeks)
- If weekly average weight drops faster than ~0.75 lb/week and workouts feel weaker: **+100 kcal/day**
- If weight is flat for 2 weeks and waist is not improving: **-100 kcal/day**
- If performance is improving and waist/weight trend are good: **hold steady**

## Preferred meal structure (your input)

Default day:
1. **Huel shake + 2% milk**
2. **Huel shake + 2% milk**
3. **High-protein dinner**

This is valid as long as daily macros and fiber are covered.

### Example macro split
- Shake 1: ~500-650 kcal, 35-50g protein
- Shake 2: ~500-650 kcal, 35-50g protein
- Dinner: ~900-1,200 kcal, 70-90g protein

> Check your exact Huel serving + milk quantity in app labels and log precisely.

## Dinner template (high compliance)

Build dinner with:
- **Protein:** 8-12 oz lean meat/fish OR tofu/tempeh equivalent
- **Carb:** 1.5-3 cups cooked rice/potato/pasta depending on run day
- **Vegetables:** at least 2 fists
- **Fat:** 1-2 tbsp olive oil / avocado / nuts

### Run-day carb tweak
- Interval/tempo days: add +25-60g carbs (fruit, rice, oats, bread)
- Rest/recovery day: keep carbs slightly lower if appetite is low

## Minimum nutrition floors

- Protein: never below **150g/day**
- Fiber: at least **25-35g/day**
- Water: **2.5-3.5 L/day**
- Sodium: do not under-salt, especially on running days

---


## Execution checklist (simple)

Use this daily:
- Hit **protein first** (150g absolute minimum; 165-185g target).
- Keep calories in the **2,250-2,350** range most days.
- On interval/tempo days, add carbs around training.
- If sleep is poor, keep food quality high and avoid large under-eating.

Use this weekly:
- Compare 7-day average bodyweight + waist trend + training quality.
- Then apply only one adjustment from the rules above.

## Logging protocol in this repo/chat

When you message updates, include:
- time
- workout completed (or rest)
- meals/snacks with rough quantities
- optional: energy (1-5), hunger (1-5)

I will translate your updates into:
- daily log entries in `/logs/`
- macro estimates and day-end summary
- next-day adjustments if needed
