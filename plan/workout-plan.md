# Workout Plan (v1 - hybrid recomp + running + calisthenics)

**Goal:** body recomposition while improving stamina, calisthenics skill, and daily mobility/flexibility.
Built for your current setup: **home + outdoors** with pull-up bar, rings, bands, weighted vest, mat, blocks, foam roller.

## Weekly schedule (5-6 days)

- **Mon — Upper Strength + Core + Shoulder mobility** (~55-70 min)
- **Tue — Run Intervals + Lower mobility** (~45-60 min)
- **Wed — Lower Strength + Core + Hip mobility** (~55-70 min)
- **Thu — Easy/Tempo Run + Mobility flow** (~40-60 min)
- **Fri — Calisthenics Skill + Upper accessory** (~50-65 min)
- **Sat — Zone 2 run OR long mobility/recovery** (~30-60 min, optional but recommended)
- **Sun — Full rest**

> Morning default: train within 60-90 minutes after waking when possible.

## Week 1 baseline rule

Because current maxes are unknown, use Week 1 to find baseline performance:
- pick variations that leave **1-2 reps in reserve (RIR)**
- write best top set for **squat, push-up, pull-up, dip**, plus handstand hold time and running pace in your daily logs
- use those numbers to progress weekly

3. Easy mixed session: 20 min walk + 15 min mobility

---

## Progression rules (simple)

- Keep most sets at **RIR 1-2**.
- When all sets hit top of range with good form, progress by one:
  - harder variation,
  - +1-2 reps,
  - +5-10 sec hold,
  - less band assistance,
  - or small external load (weighted vest/backpack).
- Deload every 4th-6th week (or after high fatigue week): reduce sets by ~30-40%.
- After 2+ nights of poor sleep, keep intensity but reduce volume by ~20% that day.

## Ab/Core strength focus

Yes, this plan should increase ab strength if you progress these consistently:
- Day 1: Hollow hold + front plank
- Day 3: Hanging knee/leg raises + side plank
- Day 5: Tuck L-sit + frog stand/handstand bracing

Progression target: add 5-10 sec to holds or 1-2 reps weekly when form stays solid.

## Explicit skill tracks included

This plan directly progresses:
- **Squat** (Day 3 + squat mobility)
- **Push-up** (Day 1 + Day 5)
- **Pull-up** (Day 1 + Day 5)
- **Dips** (Day 1 support + Day 5 dip progression)
- **Handstand** (Day 5 wall handstand + pike progression)
- **Running** (Day 2 intervals + Day 4 easy/tempo + optional Day 6 Zone 2)
- **Mobility/flexibility** (built into every training day + optional long session)
- **Ab/core strength** (Days 1/3/5 direct core work + bracing under skill work)

## Are these workouts good for you? (quick self-audit)

Use this checklist weekly. If you answer "yes" to most, the plan is working:
- You completed at least **4-5 sessions** this week.
- Main lifts/skills are stable or improving (more reps, cleaner reps, longer holds, or better control).
- Running feels gradually easier at the same pace OR pace improves at similar effort.
- No persistent joint pain (normal muscle soreness is okay).
- Sleep/energy are stable enough to train.

If 2+ are "no" for 2 weeks:
- reduce total sets by ~20-30% for 1 week,
- keep movement quality high,
- keep protein high and avoid aggressive calorie cuts,
- then rebuild volume.
