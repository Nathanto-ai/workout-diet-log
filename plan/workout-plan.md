# Workout Plan (v0)

**Goal:** recomp (lose fat slowly while building/keeping strength), improve running stamina, and increase mobility.
This is built to work with minimal equipment (pull-up bar + floor).  
If you add rings/bands/vest later, see `progression.md`.

## Weekly schedule (5 days + optional)

- **Mon — Upper + Core + Shoulder/Spine mobility** (~55–65 min)
- **Tue — Running intervals + Hips/Ankles mobility** (~45–60 min)
- **Wed — Lower + Core + Hips/Ankles mobility** (~55–65 min)
- **Thu — Easy/tempo run + Spine/Shoulders mobility** (~45–60 min)
- **Fri — Full-body skill + Wrists/Shoulders mobility** (~55–65 min)
- **Sat — Optional: Long mobility + easy walk/jog** (30–60 min)
- **Sun — Rest**

## How hard should this feel?

- Strength sets: stop with **1–2 reps in reserve (RIR)** most of the time.
- Running: intervals feel hard but controlled; tempo is “can talk in short phrases”.

## Progression rules (simple)

Pick a rep range and **earn progression**.

- If you hit the **top of the range** for all sets with 1–2 RIR → next week make it harder:
  - harder variation, OR
  - add 1–2 reps per set, OR
  - add 5–10 sec per hold, OR
  - reduce assistance (less band help, less incline), OR
  - add load (vest/backpack)

Deload every 4th week if needed: do **~70%** of your normal sets.
