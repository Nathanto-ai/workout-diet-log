This note cross-checks the current plan against mainstream guidance and major reviews.

## Sources reviewed

- WHO physical activity guidance for adults: 150-300 min moderate aerobic activity weekly + muscle-strengthening 2+ days/week.
  - https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/physical-activity
- CDC adult activity guidelines (same core public-health targets as U.S. guidance).

- Protein for muscle gain meta-analysis (Morton et al., 2018): benefits plateau around ~1.6 g/kg/day, with higher intakes reasonable for some contexts.

## Does your current plan align?

Yes, generally **yes**.

- **Training frequency**: 5 core training days + optional 6th recovery day is compatible with strength, running, and skill goals.
- **Aerobic work**: 2 run days (+ optional Zone 2 day) is enough to improve stamina if progressed gradually.
- **Strength/skills**: squat, push-up, pull-up, dip, and handstand are all trained at least weekly with progression rules.
- **Recovery controls**: built-in deload/fatigue rules and sleep-based volume reduction are appropriate.
- **Nutrition**: your calorie target (small deficit/near maintenance) and high-protein focus are reasonable for recomposition.

## Practical interpretation for you

- Keep the current structure.
- Progress slowly (RIR 1-2, small weekly changes).
- Use the weekly check-in to adjust only one variable at a time (usually calories first).
- If recovery stalls for 7-10 days, reduce volume ~30% for 1 week (deload) and rebuild.

## Workout quality verdict (specific to your plan)

Your workouts are **good and appropriately structured** for your goals because they combine:
- 3 strength/skill-focused days,
- 2 running-focused days,
- near-daily mobility,
- progression and deload rules.

The plan will work if you keep adherence high, progress gradually, and adjust from weekly trends.
