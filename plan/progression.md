# Progression (v1)

## Core method

- Train most sets at **RIR 1-2**.
- Progress only when form is stable.
- Prioritize: consistency > intensity spikes.

## Baseline week metrics to track

Capture these in Week 1:
- Squat best set (strict reps at chosen variation)
- Pull-up best set (strict reps)
- Push-up best set (strict reps)
- Dip best set (or support hold duration)
- Handstand best hold duration (wall)
- Front plank max hold with good position
- Interval run pace/effort notes
- Easy run conversational pace duration

Use those as your personal baseline and compare every 2 weeks.

## Upper-body progressions

### Pulling
1. Scapular pulls + passive hangs
2. Band-assisted pull-ups
3. Eccentric pull-ups (3-5 sec down)

### Pushing
1. Incline push-up
2. Standard push-up
3. Ring push-up
4. Decline push-up / pseudo-planche lean push-up
5. Weighted push-up (vest/backpack) or ring dip progression

### Vertical push skill
1. Pike hold
2. Pike push-up
3. Feet-elevated pike push-up
4. Wall handstand hold
5. Wall handstand push-up eccentric progression

### Dip progression
1. Ring support hold / bench support hold
2. Feet-assisted ring dip eccentric
3. Banded or controlled full dip
4. Full dip (strict ROM)
5. Weighted dip (vest/backpack)

## Lower-body progressions

### Squat progression (primary lower skill)
1. Counterbalance squat to comfortable depth
2. Full bodyweight squat (controlled depth)
3. Tempo squat (3 sec down)
4. Pause squat (1-2 sec in bottom)
5. Loaded squat (weighted vest/backpack/front-loaded)

### Single-leg accessory progression
1. Split squat
2. Bulgarian split squat
3. Add pause (1-2 sec at bottom)
4. Add slower eccentric (3 sec down)
5. Add load (backpack/bands/rings support as needed)

For posterior chain, progress glute bridges from bilateral to single-leg to loaded.

## Core progression (ab strength)

### Hollow hold
1. Tuck hollow
2. One-leg extended hollow
3. Full hollow
4. Hollow rocks

### Plank
1. Front plank (short holds)
2. Front plank (longer holds)
3. RKC plank (hard-style brace)
4. Weighted plank (vest/backpack)

### Hanging core
1. Hanging knee raise
2. Slow hanging knee raise (pause at top)
3. Hanging leg raise
4. Toes-to-bar progression

Rule: progress by +5-10 sec on holds or +1-2 reps when form stays strict.

## Running progression

### Intervals
- Start: 1:1 work:easy × 8
- Build to ×10
- Then increase hard segment to 75-90 sec while keeping total stress manageable

### Easy/tempo
- Easy run: add 5 min every 1-2 weeks up to 45 min
- Tempo run: start 15-20 min, build toward 25-30 min as tolerated

If sleep is poor or legs feel beat up, replace one run with brisk walk + mobility.

## Deload / fatigue management

Take a deload week when:
- performance drops >2 sessions in a row,
- motivation is very low,
- sleep is poor for most of the week,
- joints feel irritated.

Deload protocol:
- keep same movements,
- reduce sets by 30-40%,
- keep reps submaximal.
