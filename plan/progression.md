# Progression (v0)

## How to pick the right variation

Your working sets should be:
- hard, but controlled
- stop with **1–2 reps in reserve (RIR)**

If you fail early:
- switch to an easier variation immediately
- keep total sets the same

## Upper-body progressions

**Pull-ups**
1. Dead hang + scap pulls
2. Negative pull-ups (3–5 sec down)
3. Band-assisted pull-ups
4. Full pull-ups
5. Weighted pull-ups (vest/backpack)

**Push-ups**
1. Wall push-ups
2. Incline push-ups
3. Knee push-ups
4. Standard push-ups
5. Decline / diamond / weighted

**Dips**
1. Bench dips (bent knees)
2. Bench dips (straight legs)
3. Parallel bar dips (band-assisted if needed)
4. Full dips
5. Weighted dips

## Lower-body progressions

**Split squat / Bulgarian split squat**
1. Split squat (rear foot on floor)
2. Bulgarian (rear foot elevated)
3. Slower eccentric (3 sec down)
4. Pause at bottom (1–2 sec)
5. Loaded (dumbbells/vest/backpack)

## Core hold progressions

**Hollow hold**
- tuck → one-leg → full hollow

**L-sit**
- seated leg lifts → tuck hold → one-leg out → full L

## Running progression

Weeks 1–2:
- Intervals: 1:1 work:rest × 8
- Tempo: 15–20 min or easy run

Weeks 3–4:
- Intervals: add 1–2 rounds (to 9–10) OR increase hard segment to 75–90 sec
- Tempo: +5 min (up to 25)

If shin/knee pain:
- replace one run with brisk incline walk or bike
- add calf raises + tibialis raises 2–3×/wk
